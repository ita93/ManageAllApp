# ManageAllApp

Why we need this reposity?
I don not want to require user update an applicaiton for some small changes. Like: change ref links, enable or disable adversite, .........
So I will save these status in this reposity (one file for each project, or it will be increase to folder if the number of statu be large, or so hard to manage in only one file).

Ref between file and project:
(File name, project, remark)
AppManage - Good Game esport  - only for advs (e/d) - bitbucket repo: https://bitbucket.org/onijelly/goodgamewellplay
